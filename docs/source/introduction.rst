Introduction
============

``scikit-duplo`` is a Python package which provides a set of classes that extend the
functionality of scikit-learn pipelines.


Motivation
**********

Scikit-Learn provides a fast way to compose machine learning pipelines and experiment
with a wide variety of machine learning approaches. However, the standard classes that
are provided by the package makes certain approaches difficult to implement.

This library is inspired by scikit-lego which extended scikit-learn with a set of very
useful classes to build improved machine learning pipelines. Scikit-duplo is a simple
set of transformers and meta learners that are not available in either package.
